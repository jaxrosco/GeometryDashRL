# Reinforcement Learning For Geometry Dash
A fun project for my Topics in Computer Science class.

## Description
Using a custom gym environment and stable-baselines3, I aimed to train a model by reinforcement learning to play the game [Geometry Dash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash/) by RobTop Games. While not entirely successful so far, I've had a lot of fun with it.

## Requirements
On top of what is listed in the [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file in the repository, you'll also need a copy of Geometry Dash so the model can interact with the game. I would also recommend using a gpu if possible to speed up the actual training process.

## How It Works
